## Syntactic rules
program = statementList | "param(" declaration {"," declaration} ")" statementList  .

# Statement
statementList = statement | statement ";" statementList .
statement = operationList | ioStatement | ifStatement | whileStatement .

# Operation
operationList = operation ";" | operation ";" operationList .
operation = simpleOperation | assignment .
simpleOperation = identifier arithmeticOperator identifier .

# Assignment
assignment = lhs assignmentOperator rhs | readStatement .
lhs = identifier | declaration .
rhs = identifier | simpleOperation .

# Declaration
declarationList = declaration ";" | declaration ";" declarationList .
declaration = "[" type "]" identifier .

# Type
type = "int" | "string" | "bool" | "array" .

# IOStatement
ioStatement = readStatement ";" | writeStatement ";" .
readStatement = lhs assignmentOperator "Read-Host" .
writeStatement = "Write-Host " identifier .

# If
ifStatement = "if(" compoundCondition ") {" statementList "}" .

# While
whileStatement = "while(" compoundCondition ") {" statementList "}" .

# Condition
compoundCondition = condition | "(" condition ")" comparisonOperator "(" compoundCondition ")"
condition = identifier comparisonOperator identifier .

# Operators
equalityOperator = "-lt" | "-le" | "-eq" | "-ne" | "-gt" | "-ge"
comparisonOperator = "-and" | "-or" | "-not" .
arithmeticOperator = "+" | "-" | "*" | "/" | "%" .
assignmentOperator = "=" .

## Lexical rules
identifier = "$" letter{letter}{digit} .
letter = "A" | "B" | ... | "Z" | "a" | "b" | ... | "z" .
digit = "0" | "1" | ... | "9" .
string = "\"" {char} "\""
char = letter | digit
const = ("1" | "2" | ... | "9" ) {digit}
